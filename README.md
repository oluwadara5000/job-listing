## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

```js
listingTwo.classList.add("python", "javascript", "html", "css");

listingFour.classList.remove("python", "javascript", "html", "css");
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Styling](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me to apply the CSS Grid for styling some elements on a particular screen size. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Filtering](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand filtering and it was useful in helping me tackle that problem. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
